    "### Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n",
    "is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Meaning, it supports different programming approach.One of the popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)."

    "there are several benfits, some are given below.\n",
    "* Object-oriented programming fosters reusability. A computer program is written in the form of objects and classes, which can be reused in other projects as well.\n",
    "* The modular approach used in object-oriented programming results in highly maintainable code.\n",
    "* In object-oriented programming, every class has a specific task. If an error occurs in one part of the code, you can rectify it locally without having to affect other parts of the code.\n",
    "* Data encapsulation (which we will study later in the article) adds an extra layer of security to the program developed using the object-oriented approach.\n"

    "### Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "A **method** refers to a function which is part of a class. You access it with an instance or object of the class. A **function** doesn’t have this restriction: it just refers to a standalone function. This means that all methods are functions, but not all functions are methods.<br>\n",
    "Consider this example, where you first define a function plus() and then a addition class with a sum() method:\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "#Define a function `plus()`\n",
    "def plus(a,b):\n",
    "  return a + b\n",
    "  \n",
    "#Create a `addition` class\n",

    "  def sum(self, a, b):\n",
    "    self.contents = a + b\n",
    "    return self.contents \n",
    "</code>\n",
    "If you now want to call the sum() method that is part of the addition class, you first need to define an instance or object of that class. So, let’s define such an object:\n",

    "#### Class\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for the object.\n",
    "We can think of class as an sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot. Here, parrot is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example for class of parrot can be :\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "class Parrot:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "#### Object\n",
    "An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.the class object could be used to access different attributes.\n",
    "It can also be used to create new object instances (instantiation) of that class. The procedure to create an object is similar to a function call.\n",
    "**eg:**<br>\n",
    "sumIns = addition()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute\n",
    "A class by itself is of no use unless there is some functionality associated with it. Functionalities are defined by setting attributes, which act as containers for data.\n",
    "**eg:**<br>\n",
    "Parrot is an object.<br>\n",
    "name, age, color are attributes\n",
    "#### Behaviour\n",
    "Objects in Python are generally classified according to their behaviors and the features that they implement.<br>\n",
    "**eg:**<br>\n",
    "Parrot is an object.<br>\n",
    "singing, dancing are behavior"
